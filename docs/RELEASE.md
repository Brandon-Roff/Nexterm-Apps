# 🚀 Release Automation

This document explains how the automated release system works for Nexterm Apps.

## 📋 Overview

The release system automatically creates GitHub releases with zip packages whenever the version is updated. It uses semantic versioning starting from 1.0.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Version File**: The `.version` file contains the current version number
2. **GitHub Actions**: Workflow triggers on changes to the version file
3. **Auto Release**: Creates tagged release with changelog and assets
4. **Zip Packages**: Includes both `.zip` and `.tar.gz` formats

## 📁 Release Package Contents

Each release package includes:

```
nexterm-apps-X.X/
├── apps/                    # All application configurations
├── logos/                   # Application icons
├── helper_scripts/          # Utility scripts
├── README.md               # Documentation
├── Apps.md                 # Application list
├── LICENSE                 # License file
├── VERSION.txt             # Release information
└── install.sh              # Quick install script
```

## 🛠️ Version Management

### Using the Version Script (Recommended)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Show current version
./scripts/version.sh current

# Bump patch version (1.0 -> 1.1)
./scripts/version.sh bump

# Bump minor version (1.0 -> 2.0)
./scripts/version.sh bump minor

# Set specific version
./scripts/version.sh set 1.5

# Bump version and commit (ready for release)
./scripts/version.sh release
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Show current version
.\scripts\version.ps1 current

# Bump patch version
.\scripts\version.ps1 bump

# Bump minor version
.\scripts\version.ps1 bump minor

# Set specific version
.\scripts\version.ps1 set 1.5

# Bump version and commit
.\scripts\version.ps1 release
```

### Manual Version Update

1. **Edit the version file:**
   ```bash
   echo "1.1" > .version
   ```

2. **Commit the change:**
   ```bash
   git add .version
   git commit -m "🔖 Bump version to 1.1"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Automatic release creation:**
   - GitHub Actions detects the version change
   - Creates a new release with tag `v1.1`
   - Generates changelog from commit history
   - Creates and uploads zip packages

## 📦 Release Triggers

The workflow automatically triggers on:

- ✅ Changes to `apps/` directory (new or updated apps)
- ✅ Changes to `logos/` directory (icon updates)
- ✅ Changes to `Apps.md` (documentation updates)
- ✅ Changes to `.version` file (version bumps)
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch

## 📝 Changelog Generation

The system automatically generates changelogs:

### First Release (v1.0)
- Lists all included applications
- Highlights key features
- Provides getting started instructions

### Subsequent Releases
- Shows commit messages since last release
- Highlights new applications and updates
- Includes statistics (app count, etc.)
- Links to full changelog on GitHub

## 🏷️ Version Numbering

The project uses a simplified semantic versioning:

- **Major.Minor** format (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- **Patch bumps** increment minor version (1.0 → 1.1)
- **Minor bumps** increment major version (1.0 → 2.0)
- **Major bumps** increment major version (1.0 → 2.0)

## 📊 Release Assets

Each release includes:

1. **Source Code** (auto-generated by GitHub)
   - `Source code (zip)`
   - `Source code (tar.gz)`

2. **Application Packages** (created by workflow)
   - `nexterm-apps-X.X.zip` - Windows-friendly format
   - `nexterm-apps-X.X.tar.gz` - Linux-friendly format

3. **Installation Script**
   - Included in packages for easy app deployment
   - Usage: `./install.sh <app-name>`

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Release Workflow

Edit `.github/workflows/release.yml` to customize:

- **Triggers**: Change when releases are created
- **Package contents**: Modify what files are included
- **Changelog format**: Customize changelog generation
- **Asset names**: Change package naming convention

### Version Script Features

The version management scripts support:

- ✅ Current version display
- ✅ Version bumping (patch/minor/major)
- ✅ Custom version setting
- ✅ Automated commit and release preparation
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Bash + PowerShell)

## 🚀 Quick Release Process

1. **Make your changes** (add apps, update configs, etc.)
2. **Bump version**: `./scripts/version.sh release`
3. **Push changes**: `git push origin main`
4. **Wait for automation** - Release will be created automatically!

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### Release Not Created
- Check if `.version` file was actually modified
- Ensure workflow has necessary permissions
- Verify GitHub Actions are enabled for the repository

### Missing Assets
- Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
- Ensure all referenced files exist in the repository
- Verify zip creation step completed successfully

### Version Conflicts
- Use `git tag` to see existing releases
- Ensure new version number is higher than the last release
- Check for duplicate version numbers
